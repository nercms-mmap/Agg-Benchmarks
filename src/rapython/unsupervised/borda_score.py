Borda Score Algorithm

This module provides an implementation of the rank aggregation algorithm
using score rules. This implementation is based on the following reference:

Reference:
-----------
- Boehmer, N., Bredereck, R., & Peters, D. (2023, June). Rank aggregation using scoring rules. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (Vol. 37, No. 5, pp. 5515-5523).

Authors:

Input Format:
-------------
The input to the algorithm should be in CSV file format with the following columns:
- Query: Does not require consecutive integers starting from 1.
- Voter Name: Allowed to be in string format.
- Item Code: Allowed to be in string format.
- Item Rank: Represents the rank given by each voter.

Output Format:
--------------
The final output of the algorithm will be in CSV file format with the following columns:
- Query: The same as the input.
- Item Code: The same as the input.
- Item Rank: The rank information (not the score information).
  - Note: The smaller the Item Rank, the higher the rank.
