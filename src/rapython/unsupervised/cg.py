Competitive Graph Algorithm

This module implements the competitive graph approach for rank aggregation.
This implementation is based on the following reference:

Reference:
-----------
- Xiao, Y., Deng, H. Z., Lu, X., & Wu, J. (2021). Graph-based rank aggregation method for high-dimensional and partial rankings. Journal of the Operational Research Society, 72(1), 227-236.

Authors:
    Shiwei Feng, Qi Deng
Date:
    2023-10-20

Input Format:
-------------
The input to the algorithm should be in CSV file format with the following columns:
- Query: Does not require consecutive integers starting from 1.
- Voter Name: Allowed to be in string format.
- Item Code: Allowed to be in string format.
- Item Rank: Represents the rank given by each voter.

Output Format:
--------------
The final output of the algorithm will be in CSV file format with the following columns:
- Query: The same as the input.
- Item Code: The same as the input.
- Item Rank: The rank information (not the score information).
  - Note: The smaller the Item Rank, the higher the rank.
