Aggregation Methods Module

This module provides functions to compute aggregated scores based on various
ranking systems. The aggregation methods take a 2D array of rankings where each
row corresponds to a voter and each column corresponds to a candidate. The module
offers four types of aggregation:

- Linear Aggregation: Adds a linear score for each rank.
- Reciprocal Aggregation: Uses the reciprocal of the rank.
- Power Aggregation: Applies an exponential function to ranks.
- Logarithmic Aggregation: Uses logarithmic transformation of ranks.
